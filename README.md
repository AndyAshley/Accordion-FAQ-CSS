## Overview

This is my seventh challenge from [Front-end-mentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). It was to code and style a FAQ accordion card based on the design assets provided. I chose not to use Javascript for the challenge in this version. (static **JPG** images)

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **BONUS** Complete the challenge without using JavaScript
